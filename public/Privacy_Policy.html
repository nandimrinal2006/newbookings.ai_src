This Privacy Statement addresses NB's practices regarding information collected only directly through or from the Site-it does not address or govern any information gathering, use, or dissemination practices related to information collected other than directly through or from the Site, including, without limitation, from or via telephone, facsimile, postal mail, personal delivery, or other or additional offline means or media. NB can be contacted through the website at newbookings.ai.Collection of Personal Information from Site VisitorsNB may collect or track (1) the e-mail addresses of visitors that communicate with NB via e-mail, and (2) information knowingly provided by the visitor in online forms, registration forms, surveys, e-mail, and other online avenues (including, without limitation, demographic and personal profile data). NB also may collect or track (3) the home server domain names, e-mail addresses, type of client computer, files downloaded, search engine used, operating system, and type of Web browser of visitors to the Site, and (4) aggregate and user-specific information regarding which pages Site visitors access.NB may place Internet “cookies” on visitors’ hard drives. Internet cookies save data about individual visitors, such as the visitor’s name, password, user-name, shopping cart, screen preferences, and the pages of a site viewed by the visitor. When the visitor revisits the Site, NB may recognize the visitor by the Internet cookie and customize the visitor’s experience accordingly. Visitors may decline Internet cookies, if any, by using the appropriate feature of their Web client software, if available.NB also may use Web bugs to gather, store, and track certain information related to your visit to and activity on the Site. A Web “bug” is a file object, which can be a graphic image such as a transparent one-pixel-by-one-pixel graphics file, which is placed on a Web page or in an e-mail message to monitor user activity. A Web bug can gather, for example, the IP address of your computer, the time the Web page was viewed, and the type of browser used.Use of Personal Data CollectedPersonal data collected by NB may be used by NB for many reasons, for example, for editorial and feedback purposes, for marketing and promotional purposes, for a statistical analysis of users’ behavior, for product development, for content improvement, for fulfillment of a requested transaction or record keeping, or to customize the content and layout of the Site. Aggregate visitor data may be used for internal purposes, and individually identifying information, such as names, postal and e-mail addresses, phone numbers, and other personal information which visitors voluntarily provide to NB may be added to NB’s databases and used for future calls, mailings, and other communications regarding Site updates, new products and services, and upcoming events.NB also may use Site visitor data to contact the Site visitors regarding account status and changes to the subscriber agreement, privacy statement, and any other policies or agreements relevant to Site visitors.Disclosure of Personal Data to Third PartiesAggregate visitor data may be provided to marketing firms and other organizations providing marketing and/or marketing support services to NB.Identifiable or non-identifiable data may be disclosed or distributed (1) to another party with which NB enters or reasonably may enter into a corporate transaction, such as, for example, a merger, consolidation, acquisition, or asset purchase, or (2) to a third party (a) pursuant to a subpoena, court order, or other form of legal process, (b) in response to a request by or on behalf of any local, state, federal, or other government agency, department, or body, whether or not pursuant to a subpoena, court order, or other form of legal process, or (c) if determined by NB in its sole judgment that such disclosure or distribution is appropriate to protect the life, health, or property of NB or any other person or entity. Identifiable and non-identifiable visitor information and data which visitors provide to NB also may be provided to third parties that provide products, information, or services which MSB believes that visitors may be interested in directly or indirectly purchasing or obtaining.While B mNay undertake efforts to see that any third party to or with which NB shares, rents, sells, or otherwise discloses personal data is under a contractual obligation to use the personal data solely for the purposes for which the data was disclosed, NB is not responsible for their conduct, actions, omissions, or information handling or dissemination practices and NB will not be liable therefor.This Site may contain links to other World Wide Web sites.
